# Fast React Pizza Co.

This is a personal project where I tried to use modern concepts of React for the front end and basic concepts of C# .NET for the Back End.

The Front End displays a few options of pizza on the Menu. You can select the amount of each of these different pizzas to place an order. You will be displayed a Modal with the information of your order, including Total Amount and a pre selected date and time set as one hour from now. You can adjust that and save your order which will show on the Pizza Order List.

You will be able to also delete and update the orders that have already been created.

## How to run this app

Please clone this repo into your machine, run your server and do the same with repository https://github.com/tomas-alves08/Fast-Pizza-Co-CSharp-Back-End.

I have used Visual Studio 2022 to open the code of the Back End code and run it in there.

Both repos need to be running for you to be able to fully use the application and make actions that will interact with the database.
